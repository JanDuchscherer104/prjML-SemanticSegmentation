## Milestones
- **Semantic Segmentation** or Object Detection
- Research on state-of-the-art point cloud models
- Find fitting data sets
- Fine-tuning of a model trained on point clouds
- hyper-parameter optimization using [wandb](https://wandb.ai/site)
- (optional) rebuild model from scratch
- Adapt model to target hardware / local environment -> data acquisition
- Generate segmentation / bounding boxes for each point cloud frame
- Integrate the model into an autonomous system (optional)
- Video stream (optional)
